CookieMonster! - iConomy Money and Items for PvM

Description:
This is a continuation of Coelho's initial CookieMonster
CookieMonster is based off of the inactive iMonster, however uses none of the code from it, 
so it is extremely lightweight and fast. 


Features:
configurable item drops and economy reward for each monster
configurable economy reward for items used to kill monsters
can also be used for PvP
Supports iConomy & BOSeconomy
Ability to change entity drops with drop-rate.
Ability to add minimum and maximum money drops for randomness
A kill tracking system to check for spawn camping
- define a square-radius for area to check, including max. elevation change
- define # of kills in this area within a timespan
- anything over that number within the area will disable rewards until the records are old enough to be removed
- so far, only lasts in server memory, so records are lost on server stop/reload


doesn't allow to damage a creature/mobspawner if penalty is greater than account balance
option to only drop items for a direct kill (stops autofarmers)
option to replace normal drops with custom drops
option to drop custom drops items globally
configurable messages (including if there is no reward)
can distingush charged from normal creepers, and tame/pet wolves from wild wolves
can disable/enable rewards for defined regions


Commands:
/cookiemonster (cm) reload		reloads settings from configuration file
/cm region define <id>			set a region (once a region is selected in worldedit)
/cm region list [page]			list regions (in current world if as a player)
/cm region remove <id>			to remove regions


To-Do:
permissions? (for rewards & maybe permission to kill without penalty?)
penalties/rewards for killing players (even groups)
